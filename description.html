    <li><h3>Builder:</h3></li>
    <p>Builders are the workers that live inside the Builder's Hut. They can upgrade and build structures, as well as upgrade your Heroes. They can also craft Capital Gold in the forge. You do not need a Builder to add decorations or traps, but you need a Builder to upgrade Walls.</p>
    <li><h3>Barbarian:</h3></li>
    <p>The Barbarian is a subtroop spawned by Battle Rams and as part of the Raid Cart squad. Barbarians are single-target melee troops with low damage and moderately low hitpoints. Barbarians have no preferred target when attacking; they will simply attack the closest building.</p>
    <li><h3>Archer:</h3></li>
    <p>The Archer is a single-target ranged troop unlocked with a level 2 Barracks. She is the first ranged troop unlocked in the Barracks, and the second overall troop unlocked in the game. The Archer is a female warrior with sharp eyes.
    </p>
    <li><h3>Wallbreakers:</h3></li>
    <p>The Wall Breaker is the fifth troop unlocked in the Barracks. As the name suggests, Wall Breakers favor going after walls, dealing massive damage to them. The Wall Breaker attacks by locating the nearest protected (read: wall enclosed) building and destroying its protective Walls, blowing itself up in the process.
    </p>
    <li><h3>Pekka:</h3></li>
    <p>P.E.K.K.A is a big unit unlocked in the standard Barracks when it is upgraded to level 10 which requires Town Hall level 8. She is a slow single-target melee Elixir Troop that occupies a big amount of housing space but comes with large amounts of hitpoints and damage.</p>
    <li><h3>Valkryie:</h3></li>
    <p>The Valkyrie is a troop unlocked once the Dark Barracks is upgraded to level 3 which requires Town Hall level 8. She is a fierce warrior with orange hair, dressed in a long leather loincloth with matching leather brassiere and knee-high boots. She wields a massive double-bladed axe, which is about half of her size.</p>
    <li><h3>Wizard:</h3></li>
    <p>The Wizard is troop unlocked in the level 7 Barracks. He is a fragile ground unit with high splash damage and range. Wizards are commonly used in large groups for fire support or as a force multiplier (similar to Archers), but they can also be effective in smaller numbers, especially at lower levels.
    </p>
    <li><h3>Hogrider:</h3></li>
    <p>The Hog Rider is a fast ground troop with medium hit points, low damage, and the ability to jump over enemy Walls. He is unlocked at level 2 Dark Barracks. The Hog Rider (person) is a bare-chested dark-skinned man holding a hammer.
    </p>
    <li><h3>Barbarian King:</h3></li>
    <p>The Barbarian King is an immortal unit (since he is a hero), so he only has to be summoned once. However, if he is injured or gets defeated in an attack, he must regenerate his health by sleeping for a period of time before he can be used again. The maximum period needed for him to regenerate depends on his level; the higher it is, the longer it takes for him to regenerate.</p>
    <li><h3>Archer Queen:</h3></li>
    <p>The Archer Queen is essentially a more powerful version of the Archer. She is the second Hero, being unlocked at Town Hall 9. In addition to possessing much higher damage and hitpoints, the Archer Queen also shoots 1.5 tiles farther than a normal Archer (5 tiles instead of 3.5 tiles).
